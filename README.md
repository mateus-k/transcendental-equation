Three ways to solve a transcendental equation applied to quantum mechanics

These algorithms calculates the binding energy of the nucleus of the deuterium atom through the transcendental equation k1 k1/tan(k1 * R)=-k2;
where k1 = sqrt(2 * m * (E + V0))/hc;
      k2 = sqrt(-2 * m * E)/hc;
      hc = planck constant divided by 2pi times the speed of light in vacuum on MeV.fm;
      m = (mN * mP) / (mN + mP); reduced system mass;
      mN = neutron mass in MeV;
      mP = proton mass in MeV;
      R = radius of the nucleus of deuteron atom in fm;
      V0 = potential in MeV (well depth)
